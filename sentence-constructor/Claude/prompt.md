    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncesssary, should just start showing the vocabulary.
    - BAD: the sentence structure says a lot, give just conceptual form like this: [Subject] + [Verb] + [Object] + [Prepositional Phrase] + [Reasoning Clause].
    - BAD: The clues gives much details .We just general considirations. 
    - BAD: use questions in the Clues
    - BAD: Mentioning the used vocabulary in the clues
